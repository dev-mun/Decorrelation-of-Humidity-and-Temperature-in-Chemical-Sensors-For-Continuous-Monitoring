Motivation
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

1. Chemical sensors are sensitive to humidity and temperature.
2. Cross-sensitivity challenges the task of identifying and quantification of violations in uncontrolled scenarios .
3. To build a model that predicts the changes in the sensor conductance as a function of humidity and temperature variations.

Model 
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

1. Obtain gas sensor  data from a sensing device 
2. Preprocess the sensor data
3. Input the preprocessed data in to a machine learning model (Artificial Neural Network)
4. Receive predicted discrimination among banana, wine, baseline response as output from the machine learning model

Data Collection 
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

1.Data has been obtained from UCI Machine Learning Repository 
2. Dataset has recordings of a gas sensor array composed of 8 MOX gas sensors, and a temperature and humidity sensor.
3. This sensor was exposed to background home activity while subject to two different stimuli: wine and banana

Conclusion 
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

We can confirmed that the most statistically significant factors are humidity changes and correlated changes of temperature and humidity
To show how the humidityâ€“temperature correction model works for gas discrimination, we constructed a model for online discrimination among banana, wine and baseline response.
This shows that pattern recognition algorithms improve performance and reliability by including the filtered signal of the chemical sensors.
